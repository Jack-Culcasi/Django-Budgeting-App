                    <p>A rule consists of a note and either a Category or a Fixed Cost.
                        Whenever you upload a CSV file during the Payday process, the system checks for rules. 
                        If a transaction description contains the text of a rule's note, it will be assigned to the Category or Fixed Cost defined in the rule. 
                        For example, if you create a rule with the note 'Lidl' and the Category 'Groceries', 
                        any transaction in your CSV bank file with 'Lidl' in the description will automatically be assigned to the 'Groceries' Category. 
                        You can see the Categories pre-selected on the page displayed after you upload the CSV file.
                        If it is a Fixed Cost, it will appear at the top of the page. So, a transaction in your CSV file that looks like this:

                        The Date field is already correctly named, and since the Time field is not present in the CSV file, it will be skipped. 
                        However, we do need to update the Transaction Description field to "Description" and the Amount field to "Withdrawls" as it represents the transaction amount.
